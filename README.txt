SubSim
======

SubSim is a simulator for the UWE MSc Robotics amd ATE group project which involves building an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to take part in the Student Autonomous Underwater Challenge - Europe (SAUC-E) 2010.

It is built using the Irrlicht engine for graphics and the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) for physics simulation. The simulation is controlled using the Player network server so that control code written for the submarine can hopefully be used with minimal modification for the real worl submarine
