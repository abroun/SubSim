- Setup the world to match the layout of the SAUC-E arena
    - Add in the harbour floor, pipe and survey wall - 19/3/2010
    - Add in a start area and 'pinger' which isn't visible to the submarine's camera

- Give entities a physical representation
    - Put a compound collision shape and rigid body on the entity class
    - Add physics to the sub and check that it pushes the Buoy, or at least registers the impact

- Make the simulation more closely resemble the challenge
    - Get everything to a more appropriate scale, and position gates and obstacles correctly
    - Create 3D models for entities in the simulation (see if you can find somebody artistic to do this)

- Create unit tests for the HighPrecisionTime class

- Write an article about the simulator on the Sub google group

- Draw 3D axes as a GUI element on screen - Drawn, but not as GUI

- Create a replacement debug camera class to give more control over the cameras initial position and also to let the camera be moved ithe the keyboard

- Create a test harness that will start up the simulator along with a control program and rate the control program on how well it does at completing the course

- Make SubSim into a Debian package - this will require an Irrlicht and Bullet package as well

Plan for the RobBoard control System
====================================

- Use RoBoard howto to get stripped down Ubuntu running on an SD card
- Install OpenCV, Player and if possible the RoBoard control drivers
- Write a very simple reactive control program that tracks an orange blob (the buoy) using a USB webcam
- Get the control program to start up when Linux boots up
- Put this in the sub...

Coordinate system
=================

The coordinate system in the simulator is right-handed (as opposed to Irrlicht which is left-handed)

The z-axis in the simulator points up so it is Irrlict's y-axis
The x-axis in the simulator points along Irrlicht's positive x-axis
The y-axis in the simulator points along Irrlicht's positive z-axis

So, in order to move from simulator space into Irrlict space we need to rotate -90 degrees around the x-axis and then reverse the y-axis.

To get back from Irrlicht space we need to reverse the process by flipping the y-axis and rotating 90 degrees around the x-axis
