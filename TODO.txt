- Draw 3D axes as a GUI element on screen - Drawn, but not as GUI
- Work out the best way to export .x files from Blender - Done

- Create Swimming pool, buoy and gate objects (quickly)
- Write some code to transform between the two co-ordinate systems (and unit test it)
- Add a debug camera to look around the scene
- Transfer over to laptop

Coordinate system
=================

The coordinate system in the simulator is right-handed (as opposed to Irrlicht which is left-handed)

The z-axis in the simulator points up so it is Irrlict's y-axis
The x-axis in the simulator points along Irrlicht's positive x-axis
The y-axis in the simulator points along Irrlicht's positive z-axis

So, in order to move from simulator space into Irrlict space we need to rotate -90 degrees around the x-axis and then reverse the y-axis.

To get back from Irrlicht space we need to reverse the process by flipping the y-axis and rotating 90 degrees around the x-axis
